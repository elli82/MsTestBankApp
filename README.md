Unit-testing

This is a Bankapp originally made by some of my classmates, who kindly has let me use it for learning Unittests, using MsTest.

I chose to test: 

LogIn in User: Login_With_Correct_User_Name(), Login_With_Correct_Password() and Login_With_Correct_User_And_Password(), all these test that a User logs in with maching name and password.

LoanLimit in LoanAccount: LoanLimit_Should_Not_Be_Able_To_Loan_Over_Limit() tests that users are not able to loan more than 5 times their amount on an account.

ProcessTransaction in Transaction: ProcessTransaction_Balance_Should_Be_Correct() tests that the correct amount is transferred to the chosen account.
ProcessTransaction_Balance_Should_Not_Be_Negative() tests that it is not possible to transfer more money than exists on the account.
