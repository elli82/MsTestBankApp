# TeamGrape_BankApp
A simple Bank application made with C# and .Net Core 3.1 done by a group of students as a school project based on some stories from the bank user, the administrator, the bank owner and the system owner which you can find [here](https://qlok.notion.site/Initial-backlog-03eb10ead8f047b3aff215f8c9b47d0e).  
  
This project was part of our course "Agile system development in teams", we choose to work in a Scrum style work method with daily stand-ups and weekly retrospectives and planning meetings to ensure continious delivery of working software in short iterations. Our scrum board can be viewed <a href="https://trello.com/b/Kql7IvAp/team-grape" target="_blank">here</a>.  
## Object Oriented Design
The basic structure of our system can be visualized with this UML

To get a structure of different types of users in the system we started with an abstract class User as a base class which sub classes Customer and Admin inherits from, this leaves open possibilities to add new types of users in the future. The BankAccount class is for creating objects of bank account types, it also works a base class in which sub classes LoanAccount and SavingsAccount inherits. The Transaction class is used for handeling transactions between bank accounts so that they are processed at an interval of 15 minutes, also for the ability to list transactions for the logged in customer.
